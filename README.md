    -   #### Typography
        -   The Ubuntu font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.Ubuntu is a modern, strong looking font that is perfectly suited for a website like AlphaFitness
